# Data Lake Planning and Implementation

This project involves designing and implementing a Data Lake for a hypothetical company. The goal is to collect, store, and manage a large volume of diverse data to support business operations and analytics. The project includes planning the structure of the Data Lake, defining user roles and permissions, and ensuring data security and governance.

Additionally, the project evaluates various online cloud providers to select the most suitable platform for hosting the Data Lake. This includes assessing the provider's tools for data management, analytics, and security. The success of the Data Lake is measured by its ability to support data-driven decision-making and improve the company's revenue.

The project culminates in a comprehensive report detailing the planning, evaluation, and implementation process.
