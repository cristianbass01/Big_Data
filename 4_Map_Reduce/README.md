# MapReduce Implementation of PageRank  

## Description  
This project is part of the Big Data course (Assignment 4) and focuses on implementing the PageRank algorithm using the MapReduce paradigm. The goal is to understand the mindset behind MapReduce by developing a Python-based solution with the MRJob library.  

## Objectives  
- Implement the data preprocessing stages and MapReduce procedures for the PageRank algorithm.  
- Test the implementation on different datasets, including the Florentine families dataset and a self-selected "large" dataset.
